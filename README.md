# Snake
I wanted to create a better (or at least more personalized snake game) so I did!

(This is a work in progress, but by the end you will be able to change some of the settings as you wish, such as snake speed and board size, and it will store scores)

I know this is a little bit of a silly project, but I have been wanting to work on a bit more complex game and so I started with this.


I did originally take some of this code from https://github.com/janbodnar/Java-Snake-Game
But This was very minimal snake moving code and had many issues that needed to be fixed. All interfacing is 100% mine and I have modified almost everything that I started with, but probably good to mention. Some variable names and general structure are still the same.

When I am done gonna either just make it into an exe or find some way to distribute it (put it on steam or something in case someone wants a lil snake game)
