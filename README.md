# Snake
I wanted to create a better (or at least more personalized snake game) so I did!


I know this is a little bit of a silly project, but I have been wanting to work on a bit more complex game and so I started with this.


I just modified the code from this https://github.com/janbodnar/Java-Snake-Game
They had a bunch of issues that I fixed. Plus I am gonna add an interface to this as well and let you customize speed, size, etc.
So you can have the game you want!
