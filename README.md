# Snake
I wanted to create a better (or at least more personalized snake game) so I did!

(This is a work in progress, but by the end you will be able to change some of the settings as you wish, such as snake speed and board size, and it will store scores)

I know this is a little bit of a silly project, but I have been wanting to work on a bit more complex game and so I started with this.


I just modified the code from this https://github.com/janbodnar/Java-Snake-Game
They had a bunch of issues that I fixed. Plus I am gonna add an interface to this as well and let you customize speed, size, etc.
So you can have the game you want!
