# Snake
I wanted to create a better (or at least more personalized snake game) so I did!

Currently I still need to make this multiple files(This has been bad code practice through and through), do leaderboard stuff, and round out a few corners, but it is very good looking so that is pretty nice!

What I have really realized in this is that I have no idea how to organize graphical interface code! I made it all one file to start, because it was all one JFrame. Anyway trying to fix that.

I know this is a little bit of a silly project, but I have been wanting to work on a bit more complex game and so I started with this.


I did originally take some of this code from https://github.com/janbodnar/Java-Snake-Game
But This was very minimal snake moving code and had many issues that needed to be fixed. All interfacing is 100% mine and I have modified almost everything that I started with, but probably good to mention. Some variable names and general structure are still the same.

When I am done gonna either just make it into an exe or find some way to distribute it (put it on steam or something in case someone wants a lil snake game)
